# 📝 Bloggy

**Bloggy** is a simple blog app I built while learning **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and basic **CRUD** operations.  
It uses **React Router** for navigation and connects to my own database to manage post data.

---

It's a **Single Page Application (SPA)** that lets you:

- ✅ Add posts  
- 📝 Edit posts  
- ❌ Delete posts  

Nothing too fancy—just me practicing and figuring out the basics on my own. :)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies
### 2. Run local database

 ```bash
   npm install

npx json-server -w data/db.json --port 3500
